Here's a story:

Once upon a time in a faraway land there was a tiny village in a small valley surrounded by large mountains.
This tiny village lived in the shadow of a kingdom with a wicked queen but, as they did not have much to offer her, they heard little from her and spend most of their time in relative peace singing songs of their harvests.
This wicked queen was really just a sad and lonely old lady who really just wanted a friend.  She kept searching and searching for someone to find her worthy of friendship.  In her searching she ran across the tiny village.  She cautiously introduced herself knowing she had a reputation of being evil.
The villagers were cautious of her. One look at her finery and they all knew that she didn't belong. As she entered the town square they fled to their homes as they noticed the queen.
