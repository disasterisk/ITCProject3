Here's a story:

Once upon a time in a faraway land there was a tiny village in a small valley surrounded by large mountains.
This tiny village lived in the shadow of a kingdom with a wicked queen but, as they did not have much to offer her, they heard little from her and spend most of their time in relative peace singing songs of their harvests.  

Little did they know of the danger afoot.  The wicked queen, looking to expand her kingdom had finally taken notice of the tiny village.
